<%# This "button" will actually be a form, disguised as a button. The form will send a POST request to the delete controller action, where we will identify the post to delete and delete it.  %>
<%# In order to make a form that looks like a button, all we need to do is make a form that has no input fields, only a "submit" button with a value of "delete". So, give your form tag a method of "post" and an action of "/posts/:id/delete'. Make sure to dynamically set the :id of the form action! You'll also need to make sure the form includes the hidden input tag to change the request from post to delete.%>
